# flexion
* I would improve the test to seperate more little parts(buy, all, consume).
* I would create tests to inculde Exception cases.
* It would be nice to use more meaningful variables(var8, p).
* Better use StringUtils.isEmpty
	* purchaseId == null || purchaseId.length() == 0
	* alreadyConsumedPurchaseId != null && alreadyConsumedPurchaseId.length() != 0
* I would use 'for' or 'stream' rather than iterator
